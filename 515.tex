\section{Math Review:  Dot Product and Cross Product}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Example of Dot Product and Cross Product:

$\vec{u} = \langle 1,2,3 \rangle$

$\vec{v} = \langle 4,5,6 \rangle$

\

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32$

\

$\displaystyle \vec{w} = \vec{u} \times \vec{v} = 
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{*3{>{$}c<{$}}}
		\vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \cr
		1 & 2 & 3 \cr
		4 & 5 & 6 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
\ = \
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		2 & 3 \cr
		5 & 6 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
	\vec{i}
\ - \	
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		1 & 3 \cr
		4 & 6 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
	\vec{j}
\ + \ 
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		1 & 2 \cr
		4 & 5 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
	\vec{k}
\ = \
	-3\vec{i} + 6 \vec{j} - 3 \vec{k}
\ = \
	\langle -3,6,-3 \rangle
$

\

Is the cross product commutative?

\

$\displaystyle\vec{v} \times \vec{u} = 
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{*3{>{$}c<{$}}}
		\vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \cr
		4 & 5 & 6 \cr
		1 & 2 & 3 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
\ = \
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		5 & 6 \cr
		2 & 3 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
	\vec{i}
\ - \	
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		4 & 6 \cr
		1 & 3 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
	\vec{j}
\ + \ 
	\left|
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		4 & 5 \cr
		1 & 2 \cr
	\end{tabular}
	\right|
	\vec{k}
\ = \
	3\vec{i} - 6 \vec{j} + 3 \vec{k}
\ = \
	\langle 3,-6,3 \rangle
\ = \ -\vec{w}
$

\

No, it's anti-commutative, but that's okay.  The cross product gives a vector, $\vec{w}$, orthogonal to both $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, and a constant multiple of $\vec{w}$ is still orthogonal to both other vectors.  

\

The cross product is also not associative, but satisfies the Jacobi identity.

$$a \times (b \times c) + b \times (c \times a) + c \times (a \times b) = 0 \ \forall a, b, c \in V$$

\section{Math Review:  Algebra}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A {\bf group} is a set $S$ with an operation (``+'')  such that:

\qquad The set S is {\it closed} under the operation, meaning that if $a,b \in S$, then $a+b \in S$.

\qquad The operation is associative, meaning that if $a,b,c \in S$, then $a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$.

\qquad The set $S$ contains a unit element (``0''), such that $a+0 = 0+a = a \ \forall \ a \in S.$

\qquad For every element $a \in S$, there is an inverse element, $-a$, such that $a+(-a) = -a + a = 0$.

If the operation is commutative, meaning $a+b = b+a \ \forall \ a, b, \in S$, then $S$ is called an {\bf Abelian group.}

\

A {\bf ring} is a set $R$ with two operations, $+$ and $\cdot$, such that:

\qquad The set $R$ is an Abelian group.  

\qquad The set $R$ is closed under multiplication.

\qquad Multiplication is associative.  

\qquad The distributive laws hold:

\qquad \qquad $a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$

\qquad \qquad $(b+c) \cdot a = b \cdot a + c \cdot a$

A ring with a multiplicative identity (``1'') is called a {\bf ring with unit}.

If the ring has the property that if $a\cdot b = 0$ then $a=0$ or $b=0$, it is called a {\bf domain}.

If multiplication is commutative, then the ring is called a {\bf commutative ring}.

If a domain is commutative, then it is called an {\bf integral domain}.

\

A {\bf field} is a commutative ring with unit element (``1'') such that every nonzero element has an inverse.  

\

Quaternions are not a field because multiplication of quaternions is not commutative; however, every nonzero quaternion has a multiplicative inverse, so they are called a {\bf division ring}.

\section{Math Review:  Quaternions}
%%%%%%%%%%%

Complex numbers, $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i = \sqrt{-1}$, are two-dimensional numbers.  Quaternions, $a + bi + cj + dk$, are four-dimensional numbers.  Just as you can think of complex numbers being two-dimensional vectors having the basis vectors $1 = \langle 1,0 \rangle$ and $i = \langle 0,1 \rangle$, you can think of quaternions as four-dimensional vectors having the basis vectors 
$1 = \langle 1,0,0,0 \rangle$, 
$i = \langle 0,1,0,0 \rangle$, 
$j = \langle 0,0,1,0 \rangle$, 
$k = \langle 0,0,0,1 \rangle$, 

\

While complex numbers have the basis elements 1 and $i$ with, $i^2 = -1$, quaternions have this multiplication scheme for their basis elements.  Note that $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$, but they are anti-commutative, with, for example, $ij = -ji$.

\

The inverse of a quaternion is given by:

$$ (a + bi + cj + dk)^{-1} = \frac{a - bi - cj - dk}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}$$

\

{\bf Vector Form of Quaternions}

Think of $a + bi + cj + dk$ as the pair, $(a, \langle b,c,d \rangle )$, with a scalar part and a vector part.  

Then quaternion addition is \ $(r_1, \vec{v}_1) + (r_2, \vec{v}_2) = (r_1 + r_2, \vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2)$.

Vector multiplication is $(r_1,\vec{v}_1) (r_2,\vec{v}_2) = (r_1r_2 - \vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2, \ r_1\vec{v}_2 + r_2 \vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2)$


\subsection{Quaternions as Rotations}

We start with a vector, $\vec{p} = (p_x, p_y, p_z)$, written as a quaternion with real coordinate zero, 
$$p = p_x \mathbf{i} + p_y \mathbf{j} + p_z \mathbf{k}$$

We want a rotation of $p$ through an angle of $\theta$ about the axis defined by a unit vector $$\vec{u} =  ( u_x, u_y, u_z ) = u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k}$$ 

In two dimensions, Euler's Formula,  $e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$, gives a counterclockwise rotation of $\theta$.  We can extend it to three dimensions as
$$q = e^{ 
	\frac{\theta}{2}
	( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} )
	}
=
	\cos \frac{\theta}{2} + ( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} ) \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
$$

The rotation of $\vec{p}$ about $\vec{u}$ is given by 
$$p' = q p q^{-1}$$

Going back to using Euler's Formula for a rotation, let's look at the multiplicative inverse of $q$ and see that it's consistent with previous knowledge.  By a previous formula, 
$$a^{-1} = (a_w + a_x \mathbf{i} + a_y \mathbf{j} + a_z \mathbf{k})^{-1} = 
\frac{1}{a_w^2 + a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2} (a_w - a_x \mathbf{i} - a_y \mathbf{j} - a_z \mathbf{k} )$$

The vector $\vec{u} = u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k}$ is a unit vector with real part zero, so the denominator is 1.  
$$(\vec{u})^{-1} = (u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k})^{-1} = -u_x \mathbf{i} - u_y \mathbf{j} - u_z \mathbf{k} = -\vec{u}$$

Applying the extension of Euler's Formula, 
$$q = e^{ 
	\frac{\theta}{2}
	( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} )
	}
=
	\cos \frac{\theta}{2} + ( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} ) \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
$$

and the inverse formula

$$a^{-1} = (a_w + a_x \mathbf{i} + a_y \mathbf{j} + a_z \mathbf{k})^{-1} = 
\frac{1}{a_w^2 + a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2} (a_w - a_x \mathbf{i} - a_y \mathbf{j} - a_z \mathbf{k} )$$

we get

$$q^{-1} = \frac{1}{
	\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	 + u_x^2 \sin ^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	 + u_y^2 \sin ^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	 + u_z^2 \sin ^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	}
	\left(\cos \frac{\theta}{2} - ( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} ) \sin \frac{\theta}{2}\right)
$$

$$ = \frac{1}{
	\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	 + (u_x^2 
	 + u_y^2 
	 + u_z^2) \sin ^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	}
	\left(\cos \left( - \frac{\theta}{2} \right) + ( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} ) \sin \left(-\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)
$$

$$ = \frac{1}{
	\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	+ \sin ^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
	}
	\left(\cos \left( - \frac{\theta}{2} \right) + ( u_x \mathbf{i} + u_y \mathbf{j} + u_z \mathbf{k} ) \sin \left(-\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)
$$

$$ = e^{\frac{\theta}{2}(-u)} = \left(e^{\frac{\theta}{2}u}\right)^{-1}
$$

\section{Tuesday 28 August:  Scan Conversion of a Line Segment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{\bf Simplifying Assumptions}

1-pixel-thick line on a B\&W display (monochrome)

$m \in [-1,1]$.  More elaborate code can deal with other slopes.

Line segment described by two integer endpoints (endpoints fall exactly on pixels) $(x_s,y_s), (x_e,y_e)$

\

\hfil\begin{tikzpicture}[x=15mm, y=15mm]
	\foreach \i in {0,1,2,...,4}{
		\draw [ultra thin] (-0.5,\i) -- (7.5,\i);
	}
	\foreach \i in {0,1,2,...,7}{
		\draw [ultra thin] (\i,-0.5) -- (\i,4.5);
	}
	\coordinate (S) at (1,1);
	\coordinate (E) at (6,3);
	\fill (S) circle (5pt) node [below left] {$(x_s,y_s)$};
	\fill (E) circle (5pt) node [above right] {$(x_e,y_e)$};
	\draw [ultra thick] (S) -- (E);
\end{tikzpicture}

{\bf Main Idea}:  Activate one pixel per column from $x_s$ to $x_e$.  

\

\hfil\begin{tikzpicture}[x=15mm, y=15mm]
	\foreach \i in {0,1,2,...,4}{
		\draw [ultra thin] (-0.5,\i) -- (7.5,\i);
	}
	\foreach \i in {0,1,2,...,7}{
		\draw [ultra thin] (\i,-0.5) -- (\i,4.5);
	}
	\coordinate (S) at (1,1);
	\coordinate (E) at (6,3);
	\fill (S) circle (5pt) node [below left] {$(x_s,y_s)$};
	\fill (E) circle (5pt) node [above right] {$(x_e,y_e)$};
	\draw [ultra thick] (S) -- (E);
	\fill [red] (2,1) circle (5pt);
	\fill [red] (3,2) circle (5pt);
	\fill [red] (4,2) circle (5pt);
	\fill [red] (5,3) circle (5pt);
\end{tikzpicture}

{\bf Simple, but Slow, Algorithm}

$m = (y_e - y_s) / (x_e - x_s)$

$b = y_s - m \cdot x_s$

for $x$ from $x_s$ to $x_e$ {\color{red} \it (inclusive)}

\qquad color pixel at $(x, \lfloor m \cdot x + b + 0.5 \rfloor)$

\

The problem with this algorithm that is the $m \cdot x$, floating-point multiplication, is really computationally expensive, usually six cycles, while addition is relatively cheap, usually one cycle.  

\

Rendering algorithms have to be as fast as possible, because they run billions of times.  

\

{\bf Basic Incremental Algorithm (DDA, Digital Differential Analyzer)}

$m = (y_e - y_s) / (x_e - x_s)$

$b = y_s - m \cdot x_s$

$x_0 = x_s$

$y_0 = y_s$

for $i$ from 1 to $(x_e - x_s)$

\qquad $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) = (x_i + 1, y_i + m)$

\qquad color pixel at $(x_i+1, \lfloor y_{i+1} + 0.5 \rfloor )$ 

\

{\bf Midpoint Algorithm (Besenham)}

Developed for pen plotter.

Bottleneck was algorithm and computational speed, not hardware speed.

\

Simplifying assumption:  $m \in [0,1]$

\

Main idea

\qquad Move either E or NE in each move.  

\qquad Choose based on value of decision variable, $d$, which lets us choose betwen E and NE.  

\

\

\hfil\begin{tikzpicture}[x=15mm, y=15mm]
	\foreach \i in {0,1,2,...,4}{
		\draw [ultra thin] (-0.5,\i) -- (7.5,\i);
	}
	\foreach \i in {0,1,2,...,7}{
		\draw [ultra thin] (\i,-0.5) -- (\i,4.5);
	}
	\coordinate (S) at (1,1);
	\coordinate (E) at (6,3);
	\fill (S) circle (5pt) node [below left] {$(x_s,y_s)$};
	\fill (E) circle (5pt) node [above right] {$(x_e,y_e)$};
	\draw [ultra thick] (S) -- (E);
	\draw [red] (2.8,1.8) -- (3.3,1.8) node [right, red] {$y_Q$};
	\draw [red] (2.8,1.5) -- (3.3,1.5) node [right, red] {$y_M$};
	\fill (3,1) circle (5pt) node [below right] {E};
	\fill (3,2) circle (5pt) node [above right] {NE};
\end{tikzpicture}

Notation:   $Q$ for {\it crossing}, $M$ for {\it midpoint}.

\

{\bf Algorithm}

$d = y_Q - y_M$.  

Look at sign of $d$.  

Move NE when $d$ is positive.

Move E otherwise.  

\

{\bf Computing $d$}

Initialize $d = m - 0.5$

Increment:

\qquad for E moves:  $d = d+m$

\qquad for NE moves:  $d = d + m - 1$

\

Here's how Midpoint is cheaper than DDA:  We can change everything to integers and not have any floats.  

\

{\bf Make Everything Integers}

Scale everything by $2 \Delta x$, so that $m - 0.5$ becomes an integer.  

$d = 2 \Delta y - \Delta x$

East increment:  $d = d + 2 \Delta y$

NE increment:  $d = d + 2 \Delta y - 2 \Delta x$

\

These methods aren't what we use today.  Probably triangle scan conversion.
